Justin started his career as a recording engineer spanning several years in the early 2000â€™s. He transitioned to programming C++ apps in the public sector of local government in 2005 and eventually came to master iOS development while working for an interactive marketing company. During this time, he gained a passion for embedded systems, sparked from his love of riding motorcycles.

Over the years, Justin has worked on a plethora of embedded projects from iPhone motorcycle starters to advanced brewing and distilling equipment. Recently, Justin founded Metasphere, an embedded software company primarily focused on building Bakeware and Nerves.
